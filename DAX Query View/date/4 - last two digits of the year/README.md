To display the **last two digits of the year** along with the **day of the week (abbreviated)** and **date** in the format `Day-Month-YY` (e.g., `Mon-21-Nov-24`), you can use the `FORMAT` function in DAX with `"YY"` to get the last two digits of the year.

### **DAX Query to View Date in `Day-Month-YY` Format with Abbreviated Day and Last Two Digits of Year**

```dax
EVALUATE
VAR CurrentDate = TODAY()
RETURN 
    ROW("FormattedDate", FORMAT(CurrentDate, "ddd-DD-MMM-YY"))
```

### **Explanation**:
- **`TODAY()`**: Returns the current date.
- **`FORMAT(CurrentDate, "ddd-DD-MMM-YY")`**: Formats the date as:
  - `ddd`: The abbreviated day of the week (e.g., "Mon" for Monday).
  - `DD`: The day of the month (two digits).
  - `MMM`: The three-letter abbreviation for the month (e.g., "Nov").
  - `YY`: The last two digits of the year (e.g., "24").
- **`ROW("FormattedDate", ...)`**: Creates a one-row table with the formatted date.

### **Output Example**:
- If today's date is `2024-11-21` and it's a **Thursday**, the output will show:
  ```
  FormattedDate
  Thu-21-Nov-24
  ```

### **Power BI (Calculated Column or Measure)**:
In **Power BI**, you can use this formula for a **calculated column** or a **measure**:

#### **Calculated Column**:
```dax
FormattedDate = FORMAT(TODAY(), "ddd-DD-MMM-YY")
```

#### **Measure**:
```dax
FormattedDate = FORMAT(TODAY(), "ddd-DD-MMM-YY")
```

This will display the formatted date in `Day-Month-YY` format, where the year is represented by its last two digits (e.g., `Thu-21-Nov-24`).
