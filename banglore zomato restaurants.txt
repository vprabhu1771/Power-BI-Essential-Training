To achieve this in Power BI, follow these steps:

1. **Import the CSV File:**
   - Open Power BI Desktop.
   - Click on `Get Data` > `Text/CSV`, then select your `banglore_zomato.csv` file and load it.

2. **Create a Map Visualization:**
   - Drag the fields related to location (such as latitude and longitude or address) onto the canvas.
   - Choose the `Map` visualization type. Power BI will plot the locations on a map.

3. **Add a Slicer for Shop Name:**
   - Drag the `Shop Name` field into the slicer visual.
   - This will create a slicer that allows users to filter the map based on the shop name.

4. **Display Phone Number Based on Selected Shop Name:**
   - Create a card visual or table visual on the report canvas.
   - Drag the `Phone Number` field to this visual.
   - When a user selects a shop name in the slicer, the corresponding phone number will be displayed.

This setup will allow you to interactively select a shop name and see its phone number while visualizing the location on the map.
